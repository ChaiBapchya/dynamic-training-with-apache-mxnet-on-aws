## Dynamic Training With Apache Mxnet On AWS

Dynamic training with Apache MXNet reduces cost and time for training of DNNs (deep neural networks), by delivering a system that leverages AWS cloud elasticity, and more specifically (1) Spot Instances and (2) unused Reserved Instances. The system will reduce cost and/or time by dynamically increasing and reducing the training cluster size during training, with minimal impact on model training accuracy convergence.
